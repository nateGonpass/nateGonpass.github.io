# Hey everyone!

Welcome to my corner of the world wide web! My name is Nathan Verduzco and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Engineering.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 is very simple. All we did for part one was write code that built code that made simple calculations to find the area of rectangles based on user input. I found it immensely interesting that finding the area of a rectangle by the formula width x height is as basic as it gets when it comes to math. But it was just very fulfilling. Originally when we were working out I made it needlessly complicated and it hardly worked at all. But the professor cleaned it up for me and I understood that, that is why we have to work hard to get our degrees. Anyone can build code that "works" but a professional is going to make it clean and efficient, which is what I strive to be. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was somewhat on the other end of Lab 5. We were using for loops at this point and the amount of things we needed to know and how deep we had to know them was growing and it was easy to tell. At this point we are calling functions from separate files which seemed super scary to me at the time. But seeing all of these variables and functions work to accomplish a task that seemed kind of confusing by just reading the instructions was amazing. I learned that this is how code in real life works, this is how programs people use today work. Programs like video games and developing software. The professor once said that we are to develop good habits because when we work on multiple projects with other people it is so they can understand our code well and be able to work with as little of a hassle as possible. I can only imagine how colossal the code is for something like Elden ring. 

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 is memorable for me mostly because it kept breaking for me and my partner. I specifically remember that it would pass the first 10 tests and then quickly fail the rest. We were stuck on it for so long we must have been the only two people left in the room that day because of how long we stayed behind. It was a learning experience for me because I truly got to understand that this is what coding is really about. If I remember correctly it was simply a logic error that we just overlooked for the entire lab. This taught me a life lesson that I should have realistically picked up sooner but with the stresses and work and school I have been noticeably blind to. No matter how complex some issues can seem, there are solutions for everything, and those solutions can be simple.
